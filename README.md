## Contribution

You can contribute to the development of WarpSQL using both Gitpod and Codespaces. Follow the steps below to set up your development environment and make contributions:

## Gitpod

Click the "Open in Gitpod" button above or use the following link:[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/ChakshuGautam/postgres-tsdb-vector-docker)

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ChakshuGautam/postgres-tsdb-vector-docker)


• Wait for the Gitpod environment to be created and initialized.

• Once the environment is ready, you can start working on the project.

• Make your desired changes or additions.

• Test your changes and ensure they meet the project's guidelines.

• Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.

• Create a pull request from your forked repository to the main WarpSQL repository.

## Development with GitHub Codespaces

You can use GitHub Codespaces to develop this project in the cloud.

Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Ensure CI passes ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI-Passing-brightgreen)


Before merging any contributions or changes, it's essential to ensure that the continuous integration (CI) tests pass successfully. CI helps maintain code quality standards and prevents the introduction of regressions. To ensure a smooth integration process, follow these steps:

• Make your desired changes or additions to the codebase.

• Run the relevant tests locally to verify that your changes are functioning as expected.

• Push your changes to the branch you're working on.

• The CI system will automatically run tests and checks on your code.

• Monitor the CI build status to ensure that all tests pass successfully.

• If the CI build fails, review the error messages and make the necessary fixes.

• Repeat steps 3-6 until the CI build passes successfully.

• Once the CI build is successful, you can proceed with merging your changes into the main WarpSQL repository.

## Publish the Project ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Publish-IconName-green)


To publish the WarpSQL project, follow the guidelines below:

• Document the release process: Provide clear instructions on how to release new versions of the project. This may include steps to follow, release branches or tags, and any necessary checks or validations.

• Versioning conventions: Define the versioning scheme used for the project. It could be semantic versioning (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) or any other convention that aligns with the project's needs.

• Release notes: Prepare release notes for each new version, highlighting the changes, bug fixes, and new features included in the release. This helps users understand what to expect when upgrading to a new version.

• Distribution and deployment: Specify how the project should be distributed or deployed. If there are specific packages, containers, or deployment configurations, provide relevant documentation or instructions.
