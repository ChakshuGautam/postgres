Opinionated extensions to Postgres packaged as a single docker deployment. Why install 10 DBs when you can have everything at once (maybe not everything).

Certified as Indie Hacker's best friend!!!

### Current and future supported extensions

- [x] [PgVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)
- [x] [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb)
- [x] [Citus](https://www.citusdata.com/)
- [x] [PostGIS](https://postgis.net)
- [x] [ZomboDB](https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb)
- [ ] [PLV8](https://github.com/plv8/plv8)
- [ ] [Pg Repack](https://github.com/reorg/pg_repack)

Bootstrapped from [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-docker)

### Usage with Compose

```yaml
version: '3.6'
services:
  timescaledb:
    container_name: timescaledb
    image: samagragovernance/postgres:latest-pg15
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    env_file:
      - .env.sample
```
Users need to create their own .env.sample file with their  specific POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_PASSWORD.


WarpSQL is a powerful solution that provides opinionated extensions to Postgres, conveniently packaged as a single Docker deployment. It eliminates the need to install multiple separate databases by offering a comprehensive set of features in one place (although not everything, as some features might not be included).

By utilizing WarpSQL, you can benefit from the following:

- *Simplified setup*: With WarpSQL, you can have all the necessary extensions for your Postgres database in one go, saving you time and effort.
- *Seamless integration*: WarpSQL includes popular extensions like PgVector, TimescaleDB, Citus, and PostGIS, allowing you to leverage their functionality seamlessly.
- *Enhanced performance*: The included extensions are carefully selected to optimize database performance, enabling you to work efficiently with large datasets.
- *Extensibility*: While WarpSQL already supports a range of extensions, it aims to expand its offerings to include even more powerful tools in the future, such as ZomboDB, PLV8, and Pg Repack.
Get started with WarpSQL today and experience the convenience of a comprehensive Postgres solution.

## PostgreSQL Image Packer Template

This repository contains a Packer template for building the WarpSQL image with multiple sources and provisioners. The template supports building images based on both the Alpine and Bitnami PostgreSQL images.

#### Prerequisites

Before using this Packer template, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) 
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for building Docker images)

### Usage

To build the WarpSQL image using the Packer template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the packer directory:

   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Samagra-Development/WarpSQL.git
    cd WarpSQL/packer
2. Build the images:
    ```shell 
      packer build warpsql.pkr.hcl
    ``` 
To build only the Alpine image, you can use the `-only` option:

  ```shell
  packer build -only=warpsql.docker.alpine warpsql.pkr.hcl
  ```
  By default, all supported [extensions](#list-of-supported-extensions) are installed. If you want to install specific extensions, you can provide the `extensions` variable:
  ```shell
  packer build -var extentions='pg_repack,hll'  -only warpsql.docker.alpine warpsql.pkr.hcl  
  ```

  Note that currently only the `Docker` source has been added to the template.

You can further customize the image repository and tags by providing values for the `image_repository` and `image_tags` variables using the `-var` option. Here's an example command:
```shell
packer build -var="image_repository=your_value" -var="image_tags=[tag1,tag2]" warpsql.pkr.hcl
```

### AWS 
WarpSQL provides a streamlined approach to deploying and managing PostgreSQL databases on AWS EC2 instances, complete with a disaster recovery solution powered by Barman. 
> **Warning**
WarpSQL is a work in progress, and the current setup allows public SSH access to instances, which might not be secure.


To get started, ensure you have your AWS credentials set up and Docker,Terraform installed.

First, create Docker images using the provided Dockerfiles in the `barman` and `warpsql_ssh` directories. Once built, push these images to a public image repository.
Specify the repository where you pushed these Docker images by passing the repository URL as a variable in the Terraform command.

To launch WarpSQL with Barman, run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Samagra-Development/WarpSQL.git
cd WarpSQL/terraform/aws
terraform apply -var img_warpsql=<your_warpsql_image_repository> -var img_barman=<your_barman_image_repository>
```

You can also set the password for the Postgres instance by using the `warpsql_password` variable in the Terraform script the default value is `warpsql`.

This will initiate the deployment of three EC2 instances that include an Ansible controller, PostgreSQL and Barman Docker containers.These instances are provisioned on an Ubuntu Host OS and are fully configured, requiring no further setup on your end.
 
During any subsequent launches of the WarpSQL instance, the data is recovered from the latest backup stored by Barman.

To specify the size of each instance's disk, provide the desired size in gigabytes to the respective variables: `warpsql_disk_size`, `ansible_disk_size`, and `barman_disk_size` in the terraform script.


The Barman images are based on [ubc/barman-docker](https://github.com/ubc/barman-docker). By default, Barman performs a base backup according to the cron schedule `0 4 * * *`. If you need to modify this schedule, refer to the environment variables documentation at https://github.com/ubc/barman-docker#environment-variables.

### Ensure CI passes ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/CI-Passing-brightgreen)

Before merging any contributions or changes, it's essential to ensure that the continuous integration (CI) tests pass successfully. CI helps maintain code quality standards and prevents the introduction of regressions. To ensure a smooth integration process, follow these steps:

- Make your desired changes or additions to the codebase.
- Run the relevant tests locally to verify that your changes are functioning as expected.
- Push your changes to the branch you're working on.
- The CI system will automatically run tests and checks on your code.
- Monitor the CI build status to ensure that all tests pass successfully.
- If the CI build fails, review the error messages and make the necessary fixes.
- Repeat steps 3-6 until the CI build passes successfully.
- Once the CI build is successful, you can proceed with merging your changes into the main WarpSQL repository.
